### Hello! 👋

Welcome to my corner of the code world! I'm Eren, a self-taught full-stack developer and professional musician from beautiful Vancouver Island, Canada. When I'm not practicing Bach lute suites or free jazz improvisation, you can find me obsessing over text editing with Neovim and contributing to the Neovim ecosystem. Join me on my journey to learn and master databases, functional programming, and web development - while also brushing up on my Japanese language skills!

You can reach me here or at my [email](mailto:eb@flat9.dev).

## 🔧 What I can do

- 🖥️ Programming languages: TypeScript, JavaScript / NodeJS, Go, Lua, Clojure, ClojureScript
- 🖼️ Frameworks: React, Redux, Remix, Express, Fastify, Mongoose, Primsa, Kit
- 🤹 Other skills: SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), MongoDB, DevOps (AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker)
- 💻 Operating Systems: Linux (LPIC-1 Certified)
- 🗣️ Human languages: English, French, Japanese (こんにちは、はじめまして!)
- 🎸 Musical instruments: Guitar, bass

## 💼 What I like

I am perhaps *too* into text editing. I use [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), and I contribute to its ecosystem wherever I can. I am also a fan of Linux, and I maintain a repository of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/astridlyre/dotfiles).

My main projects at the moment:

- [Tech lead at Streamily](https://www.streamily.com): Autographs Livestreamed
- [fp](https://github.com/astridlyre/fp): A Functional programming library in TypeScript
- [zircus](https://zircus.netlify.app/): Zircus Apparel, a local Queer Underwear brand based on Vancouver Island.

## 📖 What I am learning about

- Databases and API design
- Functional programming and data-driven design
- Clojure and ClojureScript
- Shell scripting and Linux
- Japanese language

## 💪 What I do for fun

Music is my passion, and playing guitar and bass allows me to express myself creatively. I love playing jazz and classical music on guitar, and I enjoy exploring different genres on bass. In addition, I enjoy reading books about programming. You can also usually find me watching anime... just to practice my Japanese, I swear!

I also love to take pictures, which you can see on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/artsyidler).
